`8Syntax:`` 

 * trust <character> <level>

 TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect on
combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or immortal)
characters to give them access to more power without messing up the character. 
You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their natural level. 

 A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
